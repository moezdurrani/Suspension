In this project, I developed a front-wheel suspension system for a four-wheel drive vehicle, using SOLIDWORKS to design and assemble 123 parts into a functional prototype. This effort demonstrates my ability to take a concept through to a tangible outcome, showcasing skills in design, engineering, and problem-solving. The project highlights my commitment to practical innovation and my interest in automotive advancements. It's a clear example of applying technical knowledge to create real-world solutions.
